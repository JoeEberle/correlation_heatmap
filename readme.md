1. A **correlation heatmap** is a graphical representation of the correlation coefficients between variables in a data set.   
2. **Correlation** measures the statistical relationship between two variables, indicating how changes in one variable might be associated with changes in another.   
3. Correlation coefficients typically range between -1 and 1, with values closer to 1 indicating a strong positive correlation,    
4. values closer to -1 indicating a strong negative correlation, and values closer to 0 indicating a weak or no correlation.
